Running commands containerized
==============================

Rarely-used commands do not need to be installed in the workstation
or laptop operating system. They can be defined as Dockerfiles
and built into container images and used only when needed.

New command is added by:

* Putting sources to a particular subdirectory:

```
# /usr/local/share/container-sources/svn/Dockerfile
FROM registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest
RUN dnf install -y subversion && dnf clean all
WORKDIR /data
ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/bin/svn" ]
```

* For convenience, make a symlink in `$PATH`

```
# ln -s build-run-container-sudo /usr/local/bin/svn
```

* Run the command:

```
$ svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk httpd-trunk
```

# Installation

This repository contains [build-run-container](build-run-container) script
which is expected to run as root via `sudo`. It builds the container image
and then executes the command in the container with the identity of the
invoking user.

To help with running [build-run-container](build-run-container), tiny
wrapper [build-run-container-sudo](build-run-container-sudo) which just
executes it with `sudo` is also provided.

So give access to users on the machine to the build-and-run mechanism,
`sudo` needs to be configured, for example with

```
# /etc/sudoers.d/build-run-container
ALL ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/build-run-container
```
